# Mobile_Module_02

I continue building may weather app.  
I made connection with geolocalisation and weather API.  
So now we can display weather informations in each page Currently, Today and Week  
I haven chosen to code in React Native with Expo.  
I used Expo Go on my phone to open the application. [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)
